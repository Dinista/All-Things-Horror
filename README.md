### ðŸ§  Integration with LLM model
At the heart of the platform is a Large Language Model (LLM), trained and fine-tuned to generate detailed, high-quality reviews based on plot, cast, themes, and user sentiment. As soon as a new horror movie is released and added to our database, the AI generates a fresh review â€” instantly.

#### Movie Metadata with TMDB
We leverage the TMDB API to fetch rich movie data: Posters, crew, release dates, runtime and genres.
